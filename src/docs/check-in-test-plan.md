# Check-In Application Test Plan

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Volunteer Check-In application across multiple devices and browsers.

## Test Environments

### Mobile Devices
- Android phones (recent models)
- iPhones (iOS 14+)
- Tablets (iPad, Android tablets)

### Browsers
- Chrome (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Test Cases

### 1. Authentication & Access Control
- [ ] Verify only authenticated users can access the check-in page
- [ ] Verify only users with 'volunteer', 'organizer', or 'superadmin' roles can access the check-in functionality
- [ ] Verify unauthorized users are redirected to login

### 2. QR Code Scanning
- [ ] Verify camera permission request works correctly
- [ ] Verify QR code scanning works in good lighting conditions
- [ ] Verify QR code scanning works in low light conditions
- [ ] Verify handling of invalid QR codes
- [ ] Verify scanning performance (speed of recognition)

### 3. Photo Capture
- [ ] Verify camera switches to photo mode correctly
- [ ] Verify photo capture works properly
- [ ] Verify photo preview displays correctly
- [ ] Verify "retake photo" functionality works

### 4. Check-In Process
- [ ] Verify successful check-in flow end-to-end
- [ ] Verify handling of already checked-in tickets
- [ ] Verify handling of invalid tickets
- [ ] Verify error states are displayed correctly
- [ ] Verify network error handling
- [ ] Test check-in with and without internet connection (offline behavior)

### 5. UI/UX Testing
- [ ] Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
- [ ] Verify touch interactions work correctly
- [ ] Verify feedback messages are clear and visible
- [ ] Verify loading states are displayed appropriately
- [ ] Verify all buttons and interactive elements are properly sized for touch

### 6. Performance Testing
- [ ] Measure time to load the check-in page
- [ ] Measure time to initialize camera
- [ ] Measure time from QR scan to result display
- [ ] Measure time for photo upload and check-in completion
- [ ] Test with slow network connections

## Test Procedure

1. **Setup**: 
   - Prepare test devices with the required browsers
   - Create test tickets in the system
   - Ensure test users with appropriate roles exist

2. **Test Execution**:
   - For each device/browser combination, go through all test cases
   - Document any issues encountered
   - Note performance metrics

3. **Issue Reporting**:
   - Document device/browser information
   - Provide steps to reproduce
   - Include screenshots or recordings if possible
   - Note severity and impact

## Acceptance Criteria

The Check-In application is considered ready for production when:

- All critical functionality works on the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge
- The application is fully functional on at least 3 different mobile devices (mix of Android and iOS)
- All high-priority issues are resolved
- Performance meets acceptable thresholds (check-in process completes in under 5 seconds on average)
