# Penetration Testing Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the plan for conducting a penetration test on the Olympia application. The goal of this test is to identify and address security vulnerabilities before a major production launch.

## 2. Scope

The scope of the penetration test will include:

- The main web application (frontend and backend)
- The Payload CMS admin panel
- All API endpoints
- The database

## 3. Methodology

The penetration test will follow a standard methodology, including:

- **Information Gathering:** Collecting information about the application and its infrastructure.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Using automated tools to identify common vulnerabilities.
- **Manual Testing:** Manually testing for vulnerabilities that automated tools may miss, such as business logic flaws.
- **Exploitation:** Attempting to exploit identified vulnerabilities to determine their impact.
- **Reporting:** Documenting all findings and providing recommendations for remediation.

## 4. Areas of Focus

The penetration test will focus on the following areas:

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Testing for weaknesses in the login process, session management, and access control.
- **Input Validation:** Testing for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection.
- **Data Protection:** Testing for vulnerabilities related to the storage and transmission of sensitive data.
- **API Security:** Testing for vulnerabilities in the API endpoints, such as insecure direct object references (IDOR) and rate limiting issues.
- **CMS Security:** Testing for vulnerabilities in the Payload CMS admin panel, such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and insecure configuration.

## 5. Timeline

The penetration test should be conducted at least one month before the planned production launch. The test is expected to take 1-2 weeks to complete.

## 6. Deliverables

The penetration testing team will provide a detailed report that includes:

- A summary of all findings, including their severity and impact.
- Detailed steps to reproduce each vulnerability.
- Recommendations for remediation.
- A follow-up test to verify that all vulnerabilities have been addressed.
