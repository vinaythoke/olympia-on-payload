# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Based on the provided Product Requirements Document, generate a JSON object that can be used to create the initial `tasks.json` file for the Olympia platform. The root of the object should be a 'master' key, which contains a 'tasks' array. Each object in the 'tasks' array should represent a high-level feature and include the following keys: 'id', 'title', 'description', 'priority', 'status' (default 'pending'), 'dependencies' (as an array of IDs), 'details', 'testStrategy', and 'subtasks' (as an empty array). Generate approximately 20 tasks, ensuring dependencies are logical. The output should be only the raw JSON, without any surrounding text or markdown.

**Response:**
